# Welcome to my Profile!  ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=James11222&color=blue)

I'm a graduate student studying Astrophysics at Princeton University ðŸŒŒðŸ”­

My interests are in theoretical and computational astrophysics, high performance algorithms, and a little web design. My github repos consist of various projects I have worked on from analysis of cosmological simulations to teaching intro level programming courses. Along the way there are some interesting projects including games made with python and tools I made such as an automated email writer for mass distribution of information to large classes. 

If you are interested, you can learn more about me at my personal website <a href="http://www.james-sunseri.com">james-sunseri.com</a>
